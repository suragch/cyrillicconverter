Corrections: 

* Context aware contributions are for the benefit of the reviewers so that they don't throw away rare words that they might think were mistakes unless they see it in context. * A loading indicator for the conversion probably isn't needed. Hopefully it will be pretty fast since it is done locally.

Q&A feedback: 

**Traditional Mongolian rendering**: Which Unicode blocks and fonts are you planning to use? Do you need to support all devices or will you provide a web font?

I'll provide a Mongolian Menksoft font. The font on the page will use and display menksoft code/font but when the copy button is pressed, it will convert it to unicode and copy that.

**Dictionary size**: How large do you expect the initial dictionary to be? This impacts loading strategy (full download vs. on-demand fetching)

The dictionary/database will be built to include up to 2 million word conversion pairs (though in the beginning it won't be that large, probably less than 100 thousand). Compressed as text this would be about 3 MB but uncompressed it would be about 50 MB. I would prefer to download the full database when there is an update and then do on-demand fetching for smaller changes between full db updates. However, if this strategy is wrong, you can correct me.

**Conversion algorithm**: Do you have an existing algorithm/library for Cyrillic-to-Traditional Mongolian conversion, or does this need to be built from scratch?

The Cyrillic to traditional conversion is a direct dictionary lookup. The only complications are expanding Cyrillic abbreviations first and what to do if there are multiple traditional spellings for a single cyrillic word. In the case of one-to-many, we should ask the user which word to use for each one (give them the option to say yes to all for any particular word).

We will need an algorithm to convert the menksoft code to Unicode. I have the algorithm for that.

**Latin transliteration system**: Which romanization system are you using for input (e.g., SASM/Transliteration standard)?

A custom system. I'll provide the details later.

### User Experience

**Abbreviation detection**: How should the system identify abbreviations? Pattern matching, user marking, or machine learning?

Any word that is more than one letter and all caps.

**Context window size**: You mentioned "few surrounding words"—is 2-3 words before/after sufficient, or do you need more context?

Two words before and two words after unless there is punctuation.

**Unconverted word behavior**: Should the unconverted word remain in Cyrillic in the output, or be left blank, or marked with a special character?

Leave them unconverted in the output.

**Offline capability**: Given the privacy focus, would offline functionality (PWA) be valuable for your users?

A PWA would be valuable as long as it will update the database when needed.

### Moderation & Community

**Moderation workflow**: Who becomes a moderator? Is there an application process, or is it invite-only? 

There is an application process and then an invite. They should pass a short test of recognizing if 10 known words are correct or not. Then they should write a short self description of their skill/experience in traditional mongolian. This can be forwarded to a moderator who will manually approve them for moderator priveleges.

**Contribution attribution**: Do you want to display contributor names/credits on accepted translations? 

We should record who submits words and approves or edits words, but this is not publicly displayed for every word. However, it might be good to have a contributor page where user totals (number of words added/edited) are displayed. The approval rate for accepted words can also be shown. Since anonymous (non-logged in) users can also add words, these can record the IP address but would not be shown on the contributor page.

**Versioning**: If a word has multiple valid Traditional Mongolian forms, how should the system handle this? User preference, regional variants, or context-dependent? 

Ask the user which one to use for every word. There can be a choice to use the same choice every time for any particular word.

**Quality control**: Should there be a minimum reputation or approval rate before contributions go live, or does everything require moderation first? 

Everything requires a moderator approval before it is used in the central converter. It needs one moderator approval before it is accepted under probation. It needs five moderator approvals before it is fully accepted without reservation.

### Features & Scope 

**Document format support**: You mentioned "no need to update documents to the server"—are you planning to support file uploads (Word, PDF) that are processed locally, or just plain text? 

Just plain text

**Batch conversion**: Do users need to convert multiple texts in sequence, or is it one-time use per session? 

One time per session. If they want to convert another document, they can clear the input window and paste in more text.

**Export options**: Beyond copy-paste, do users need to download converted text in specific formats (.txt, .docx, etc.)? 

No need to download the converted text in the MVP. They can just copy it. 

**Pronunciation guide**: Would audio pronunciations be valuable alongside Traditional Mongolian text?

No need for audio or a pronunciation guide.
