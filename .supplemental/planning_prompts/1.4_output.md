# Cyrillic-Traditional Mongolian Converter: Project Specification v2

## Elevator Pitch
A privacy-first web app that converts Cyrillic Mongolian text to Traditional Mongolian script instantly in your browser—no server uploads required. Built on crowdsourced translation data with rigorous quality control, it empowers the Mongolian community to preserve and improve their linguistic heritage collaboratively while maintaining complete text privacy.

## Problem Statement
Mongolian speakers who want to convert between Cyrillic and Traditional Mongolian script face several challenges:
- **Privacy concerns**: Existing tools often require uploading documents to external servers
- **Incomplete dictionaries**: Many proper nouns, technical terms, and modern vocabulary lack Traditional Mongolian equivalents
- **Limited community input**: Translations are often siloed, with no mechanism for collective improvement
- **Quality inconsistency**: Multiple valid spellings exist without guidance on which to use
- **Barrier to entry**: Users shouldn't need accounts just to perform basic conversions

## Target Audience
**Primary Users:**
- Mongolian language learners and educators
- Cultural preservationists and historians
- Writers and content creators working with Traditional Mongolian script
- Government and institutional workers needing script conversion

**Secondary Users:**
- Linguists and researchers
- Diaspora communities reconnecting with traditional script
- Tourists and casual users exploring Mongolian language

## USP
- **Privacy-by-design**: All conversions happen client-side in the browser with no server uploads
- **Zero-friction access**: Instant conversion without signup
- **Rigorous quality control**: Multi-tier moderation system (1 approval = probation, 5 approvals = fully accepted)
- **Community-powered accuracy**: Crowdsourced dictionary that improves over time
- **Context-aware contributions**: Reviewers see surrounding words to validate rare/unusual terms
- **Progressive Web App**: Works offline with automatic database updates when online

## Target Platforms
- **Primary**: Progressive Web App (PWA) for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Responsive design**: Desktop and mobile web
- **Offline-first**: Full functionality without internet connection once dictionary is cached

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] **Conversion completes in <500ms** for typical text (up to 1000 words)
  - [ ] Dictionary lookup optimized with efficient data structures (hash maps, tries)
  - [ ] No loading indicator needed due to speed
- [ ] **Dictionary loading strategy**:
  - [ ] Full dictionary: Compressed 3 MB download, ~50 MB uncompressed in memory
  - [ ] Decompression happens asynchronously on load
  - [ ] IndexedDB storage for offline access
  - [ ] Incremental updates: Small delta fetches between full downloads
- [ ] **Page load time <3 seconds** on 3G connection (first visit)
  - [ ] Subsequent visits: <1 second (cached PWA)
- [ ] **Lazy loading** for moderator dashboard and non-critical features
- [ ] **Bundle size optimization**: Code splitting, tree shaking, minification
- [ ] **Menksoft font optimization**: Subset font if possible to reduce size

### Scalability
- [ ] **Client-side architecture** naturally scales (no server load for conversions)
- [ ] **Dictionary grows to 2 million pairs**:
  - [ ] Efficient data structures to handle large dictionary in memory
  - [ ] Indexing strategy for fast lookups even at scale
  - [ ] Consider Web Worker for dictionary operations if main thread blocking occurs
- [ ] **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse:
  - [ ] Submission endpoint: 10 contributions per hour per IP/user
  - [ ] Dictionary sync endpoint: Reasonable rate limits for delta updates
- [ ] **Database indexing** on frequently queried fields:
  - [ ] cyrillic_word (primary lookup key)
  - [ ] status (for filtering pending/accepted)
  - [ ] contributor_id (for user statistics)
  - [ ] created_at (for sorting)
- [ ] **CDN delivery** for static assets (app shell, Menksoft font, compressed dictionary)
- [ ] **Caching strategy**:
  - [ ] Dictionary: Long cache TTL, versioned (e.g., dictionary-v1.2.0.json.gz)
  - [ ] Service worker caching for PWA offline functionality

### Security
- [ ] **Input sanitization** to prevent XSS attacks:
  - [ ] All user-submitted Cyrillic and Latin text sanitized before storage
  - [ ] Output rendering uses proper escaping
- [ ] **HTTPS only** for all server communication
- [ ] **Authentication tokens** secured with httpOnly cookies or secure local storage
- [ ] **Rate limiting** on submission and moderation endpoints:
  - [ ] Prevent spam submissions
  - [ ] Prevent abuse of moderator actions
- [ ] **CORS policies** properly configured for API
- [ ] **Content Security Policy** headers to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] **Moderator permission checks** on server-side:
  - [ ] All moderator actions verified with JWT or session token
  - [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) for moderator vs admin
- [ ] **IP address storage**: Comply with GDPR/privacy laws
  - [ ] IP addresses for anonymous contributions stored but not displayed
  - [ ] Consider IP hashing for privacy
  - [ ] Clear data retention policy
- [ ] **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries or ORM

### Accessibility
- [ ] **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** minimum target
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation** for all interactive elements:
  - [ ] Tab order logical and intuitive
  - [ ] Enter/Space activates buttons
  - [ ] Escape closes modals
- [ ] **Screen reader support**:
  - [ ] Proper ARIA labels for all controls
  - [ ] Semantic HTML (button, nav, main, etc.)
  - [ ] Live regions for dynamic content (conversion results, notifications)
  - [ ] Alt text for icons and visual indicators
- [ ] **Color contrast**: 
  - [ ] 4.5:1 minimum for normal text
  - [ ] 3:1 for large text and UI components
  - [ ] Unconverted word highlighting uses sufficient contrast
- [ ] **Focus indicators**: Visible focus states for keyboard users (2px outline minimum)
- [ ] **Error messages**: Announced to screen readers with role="alert"
- [ ] **Language attributes**: Proper lang tags
  - [ ] lang="mn-Cyrl" for Cyrillic Mongolian
  - [ ] lang="mn-Mong" for Traditional Mongolian
  - [ ] Helps screen readers with pronunciation
- [ ] **Resizable text**: Layout doesn't break at 200% zoom
- [ ] **Motion**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion for animations

## Critical Questions or Clarifications

### Technical Architecture

1. **Custom romanization system details**: You mentioned you'll provide the Latin-to-Mongolian character mapping later. When do you anticipate having this? This will be needed for:
   - Contribution input validation
   - On-screen keyboard layout
   - Live preview rendering
   - User documentation/help section

2. **Menksoft-to-Unicode algorithm**: You mentioned you have this algorithm. What format is it in (pseudocode, existing code in a specific language)? Will it need to be ported to JavaScript?

3. **Database technology preference**: For the server-side dictionary storage, do you have a preference (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)? Given the lookup-heavy nature and potential for 2M records, I'd recommend PostgreSQL with proper indexing.

4. **Hosting & infrastructure**: Do you have preferences for:
   - Frontend hosting (Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3+CloudFront)?
   - Backend API (Node.js, Python, Go)?
   - Database hosting (managed service vs self-hosted)?

### Dictionary & Data

5. **Initial dictionary seeding**: Do you have an existing word list to seed the database, or will it start completely empty and rely on crowdsourcing from day one?

6. **Dictionary versioning**: How often do you anticipate pushing full dictionary updates vs incremental updates? (This impacts the sync strategy)

7. **One-to-many handling in database**: When a Cyrillic word has multiple valid Traditional Mongolian translations:
   - Should all variants be stored in the database?
   - How do we determine which variants to show users during conversion?
   - Do we track which variant is most commonly selected?

8. **Abbreviation database**: Should common abbreviations and their expansions be stored in the database (to avoid asking repeatedly), or should it prompt every time?

### User Experience Refinements

9. **Session persistence**: Should user choices (for one-to-many selections with "use for all") persist beyond the current page session? For example:
   - Persist in browser localStorage for future visits?
   - If logged in, store preferences in user profile?

10. **Contribution editing**: Can users edit their own pending contributions before they're reviewed? Or is it submit-once and wait for moderator feedback?

11. **Moderation feedback loop**: When a moderator rejects a contribution, should the contributor receive notification/feedback about why it was rejected?

12. **Multiple moderator review interface**: If a word is in probation (has 1-4 approvals), should moderators see who already approved it? Or should reviews be blind to avoid groupthink?

### PWA & Offline Behavior

13. **Contribution queuing**: If a user is offline and tries to contribute a word, should the PWA:
   - Queue the contribution and sync when online?
   - Disable the contribution feature entirely when offline?
   - Show an error message?

14. **Update prompting**: When a new dictionary version is available, should the app:
   - Auto-update in the background and notify user when complete?
   - Prompt user before downloading (respecting data limits)?
   - Both options, with user preference setting?

### Moderation & Community Management

15. **Moderator test scoring**: For the 10-word test during moderator application:
   - What is the passing threshold (e.g., 8/10 correct)?
   - Are the 10 words randomized or the same for everyone?
   - Who creates/maintains the test questions?

16. **Probation vs accepted logic**: You mentioned 1 approval = probation, 5 approvals = fully accepted. Questions:
   - Do probation words appear in the converter for users immediately, or only after 5 approvals?
   - If they appear in probation, should there be a visual indicator that it's not fully verified?

17. **Conflicting moderator decisions**: What happens if:
   - A word gets 2 approvals and 3 rejections?
   - Moderators submit conflicting edits to the same word?
   - Is there a senior moderator role to break ties?

### Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

18. **Document upload**: You said MVP is plain text only. For future versions, would you want:
   - Word/PDF upload with client-side text extraction?
   - Batch conversion of multiple documents?

19. **Browser extension**: Would a browser extension (for converting text on any webpage) be valuable for future development?

20. **Mobile app**: Beyond PWA, would native iOS/Android apps be in the roadmap?

---

**Next Steps**: Please review the updated specification and provide feedback on:
- Any sections that need revision based on your answers
- The critical questions above (especially #1-8 which impact core architecture)
- Whether the moderation workflow (probation → accepted) is clearly specified
- Any features that should be moved from MVP to "future enhancements"

I'm ready to refine further once I have your input!
