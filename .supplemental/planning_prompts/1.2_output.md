# Cyrillic-Traditional Mongolian Converter: Project Specification

## Elevator Pitch
A privacy-first web app that converts Cyrillic Mongolian text to Traditional Mongolian script instantly in your browser—no server uploads required. Built on crowdsourced translation data, it empowers the Mongolian community to preserve and improve their linguistic heritage collaboratively.

## Problem Statement
Mongolian speakers who want to convert between Cyrillic and Traditional Mongolian script face several challenges:
- **Privacy concerns**: Existing tools often require uploading documents to external servers
- **Incomplete dictionaries**: Many proper nouns, technical terms, and modern vocabulary lack Traditional Mongolian equivalents
- **Limited community input**: Translations are often siloed, with no mechanism for collective improvement
- **Barrier to entry**: Users shouldn't need accounts just to perform basic conversions

## Target Audience
**Primary Users:**
- Mongolian language learners and educators
- Cultural preservationists and historians
- Writers and content creators working with Traditional Mongolian script
- Government and institutional workers needing script conversion

**Secondary Users:**
- Linguists and researchers
- Diaspora communities reconnecting with traditional script
- Tourists and casual users exploring Mongolian language

## USP
- **Privacy-by-design**: All conversions happen client-side in the browser
- **Zero-friction access**: Instant conversion without signup
- **Community-powered accuracy**: Crowdsourced dictionary that improves over time
- **Context-aware contributions**: Contributors see surrounding words when adding translations
- **Real-time visual feedback**: See Traditional Mongolian script rendered as you type Latin characters

## Target Platforms
- **Primary**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Responsive design**: Desktop and mobile web
- **Future consideration**: PWA (Progressive Web App) for offline functionality

## Critical Questions or Clarifications

### Technical Architecture
1. **Traditional Mongolian rendering**: Which Unicode blocks and fonts are you planning to use? Do you need to support all devices or will you provide a web font?
2. **Dictionary size**: How large do you expect the initial dictionary to be? This impacts loading strategy (full download vs. on-demand fetching)
3. **Conversion algorithm**: Do you have an existing algorithm/library for Cyrillic-to-Traditional Mongolian conversion, or does this need to be built from scratch?
4. **Latin transliteration system**: Which romanization system are you using for input (e.g., SASM/Transliteration standard)?

### User Experience
5. **Abbreviation detection**: How should the system identify abbreviations? Pattern matching, user marking, or machine learning?
6. **Context window size**: You mentioned "few surrounding words"—is 2-3 words before/after sufficient, or do you need more context?
7. **Unconverted word behavior**: Should the unconverted word remain in Cyrillic in the output, or be left blank, or marked with a special character?
8. **Offline capability**: Given the privacy focus, would offline functionality (PWA) be valuable for your users?

### Moderation & Community
9. **Moderation workflow**: Who becomes a moderator? Is there an application process, or is it invite-only?
10. **Contribution attribution**: Do you want to display contributor names/credits on accepted translations?
11. **Versioning**: If a word has multiple valid Traditional Mongolian forms, how should the system handle this? User preference, regional variants, or context-dependent?
12. **Quality control**: Should there be a minimum reputation or approval rate before contributions go live, or does everything require moderation first?

### Features & Scope
13. **Document format support**: You mentioned "no need to update documents to the server"—are you planning to support file uploads (Word, PDF) that are processed locally, or just plain text?
14. **Batch conversion**: Do users need to convert multiple texts in sequence, or is it one-time use per session?
15. **Export options**: Beyond copy-paste, do users need to download converted text in specific formats (.txt, .docx, etc.)?
16. **Pronunciation guide**: Would audio pronunciations be valuable alongside Traditional Mongolian text?
