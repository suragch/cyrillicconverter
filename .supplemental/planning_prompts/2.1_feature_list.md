<goal>
I'd like for you to help me brainstorm the overall technical structure of my application ona  high level. You should act like a Senior Software Engineer that has extensive experience developing, and building architecture for large scale web applications. You should ask me follow up questions as we proceed if you think it's necessary to gather a fuller picture. Any time I answer questions, you re-integrate the responses and generate a fully new output that integrates everything.
