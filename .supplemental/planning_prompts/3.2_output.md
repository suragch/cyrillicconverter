### Core App Experience

#### Client-Side Conversion Engine
This is the heart of the app—the magic moment where the user's problem is solved instantly and privately. The entire experience should feel effortless, fast, and trustworthy.

-   **User Stories**
    -   **Alima (Language Learner):** *As a language learner, I want to paste a news article in Cyrillic and see the Traditional Mongolian script instantly, so that I can practice my reading without worrying about my text being stored on a server.*
    -   **Solongo (Content Creator):** *As a content creator, I want to convert text in real-time as I type, so that I can speed up my workflow without breaking my creative flow.*
    -   **Chen (Casual User):** *As a casual user, I want to use the converter without signing up or waiting, so that I can satisfy my curiosity about a few words and move on.*
    -   **Batbayar (Cultural Preservationist):** *As a preservationist dealing with sensitive texts, I want the entire conversion to happen on my machine, so that I can maintain absolute confidentiality of the documents I work with.*

-   **UX/UI Considerations**
    -   **Core Experience: The Conversion Flow**
        -   **Initial (Empty) State:** The user is greeted with a clean, two-panel layout (side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile). The left panel is the Cyrillic input, and the right is the Traditional Mongolian output. The input panel contains clear placeholder text: *"Та кирилл монгол бичвэрээ энд буулгана уу..."* (Paste your Cyrillic Mongolian text here...). A single, prominent "Convert" button is centrally located or clearly associated with the input. The output panel is empty, perhaps with a subtle logo or pattern to signify it's a target area.
        -   **Active Typing/Pasting State:** As the user types or pastes text into the input panel, a character/word count appears below the box, providing immediate feedback. The "Convert" button becomes fully active (e.g., color saturation increases). The output panel remains unchanged.
        -   **Converted State:** Upon clicking "Convert," the conversion is virtually instantaneous (<500ms). There is no loading spinner. The Traditional Mongolian text appears vertically in the output panel, rendered beautifully in the Menksoft font.
        -   **Visual Hierarchy:** The input text is secondary to the beautifully rendered, primary output. The most important elements are the text areas and the "Convert" button. Secondary actions like "Copy" and "Clear" are visible but less prominent (e.g., smaller icon buttons).
        -   **Unconverted Words:** Any word not found in either the local or community dictionary remains in Cyrillic but is visually highlighted in the output. A subtle but clear dotted red underline is a good starting point, signifying "unrecognized" without the alarming feel of a solid red error color. Hovering over the word could trigger a tooltip: "Click to add a translation." This transforms a point of failure into an opportunity for engagement.

    -   **Advanced Users & Edge Cases**
        -   **Large Text:** For exceptionally large texts that might cause a brief UI freeze (though unlikely with modern JS engines and optimized lookups), the "Convert" button could show a very brief loading state (e.g., a quick pulse animation) to reassure the user that the action was received. If this becomes a consistent issue, processing could be moved to a Web Worker to keep the UI perfectly smooth.
        -   **Offline State:** A subtle, non-intrusive indicator (e.g., a small cloud icon with a slash through it in the header) appears when the user is offline. The app remains 100% functional. The indicator's tooltip would read: "Offline mode. All conversions are using the locally saved dictionary."

#### Dual-Layer Dictionary System
This feature empowers users by giving them immediate value from their contributions while simultaneously enriching the community resource. The UX must clearly, if subtly, distinguish between the user's private dictionary and the shared public one.

-   **User Stories**
    -   **Alima (Language Learner):** *As a learner, I want to add a new slang term I just learned to my dictionary, so that it converts correctly for me immediately in my next session, even if the community hasn't approved it yet.*
    -   **Batbayar (Cultural Preservationist):** *As an expert, I want my specialized historical terms to be saved locally, so my documents convert accurately, but I also want to submit them to the community to improve the shared resource over time.*
    -   **Solongo (Content Creator):** *As a writer, I want the dictionary to automatically update in the background with new community-approved words, so that my conversions become more accurate over time without any effort on my part.*

-   **UX/UI Considerations**
    -   **Core Experience: Seamless Lookup**
        -   **The user's mental model should be simple: "The app just converts my text."** They don't need to know *which* dictionary is being used at any given moment. The `Local -> Community` lookup priority is an invisible implementation detail that simply makes the app feel smarter and more personalized.
        -   **Dictionary Updates:** When a background sync completes, a subtle, self-dismissing notification (a "toast") could appear at the bottom of the screen: "Dictionary updated with new community contributions." This reinforces the app's value and collaborative nature without interrupting the user's flow.
        -   **Information Architecture:** There is no explicit UI for "viewing" the two dictionaries separately in the main conversion flow. The distinction only becomes relevant during the contribution process.

    -   **Advanced Users & Edge Cases**
        -   **First-Time Use:** On first load, the app will need to download and cache the initial community dictionary. A lightweight progress indicator should be shown (e.g., "Downloading dictionary for offline use..."). This is a one-time cost that enables the powerful offline-first experience.
        -   **Conflicting Entries:** In the rare case where a user's local entry for a Cyrillic word differs from a community-approved one, the user's local version *always* wins. This is a core principle of the feature. There is no UI to resolve this conflict; the user's explicit choice is respected above all else.
        -   **Prolonged Offline Use:** If a user comes back online after a long time, the service worker will detect a significant version difference and may trigger a full dictionary download in the background. The app will continue to function with the older version until the new one is ready, at which point it will swap seamlessly.

### Crowdsourcing & Community

#### Contribution & Moderation
This is the engine of community growth. The contribution process must be as frictionless as possible, turning moments of "failure" (an unconverted word) into simple, rewarding interactions. The moderation workflow must be robust and efficient for our expert volunteers.

-   **User Stories**
    -   **Solongo (Content Creator):** *As a writer, when I see an unconverted word, I want a quick way to add its translation and context, so that I can fix it for myself and help the community without leaving my workflow.*
    -   **Chen (Casual User):** *As an anonymous user, I want to suggest a translation for a word I know without creating an account, so that I can make a small contribution easily.*
    -   **Ganbaatar (Moderator):** *As a moderator, I want to review new submissions in a clear, context-rich interface, so that I can make accurate judgments on their validity and maintain the quality of the shared dictionary.*
    -   **Alima (Language Learner):** *As a contributor, I want to track the status of my submissions, so I can see if my contributions are being accepted and helping others.*

-   **UX/UI Considerations**
    -   **Core Experience: The Contribution Modal**
        -   **Trigger:** User clicks on a highlighted, unconverted Cyrillic word in the output panel.
        -   **Modal UI:** A clean, focused modal appears.
            -   **Hierarchy:** The primary focus is the Latin input field for the Traditional Mongolian transliteration. A live preview of the Menksoft rendering appears directly below or beside it, providing instant feedback.
            -   **Context is King:** Above the input fields, in a slightly muted, read-only block, the context is displayed: `... [word before] **[target word]** [word after] ...`. This is crucial for moderators.
            -   **Progressive Disclosure:** An optional on-screen keyboard can be toggled for users unfamiliar with the Latin mapping. It's hidden by default to keep the interface clean.
            -   **Clear Actions:** Two clear choices are presented, perhaps as a segmented control: "Save Locally" and "Save & Submit to Community". "Save Locally" is the default to provide the quickest path to value for the user.
        -   **Feedback:** Upon submission, the modal closes and the word in the main output panel instantly updates to its newly translated form. A brief success toast confirms the action: "Saved to your personal dictionary!" or "Saved locally and submitted for review!"

    -   **Advanced Users & Edge Cases**
        -   **Anonymous Spam Prevention:** An anonymous user (like Chen) attempting to submit to the community will be subject to rate-limiting. If they exceed the limit (e.g., >10 submissions in an hour), the "Save & Submit to Community" option will be temporarily disabled. The UI will show a message: "Thank you for your contributions! To prevent spam, anonymous submissions are limited. Please try again later." They can still save unlimited words to their local dictionary.
        -   **Moderation Dashboard (For Ganbaatar):** This is a separate, protected area of the app.
            -   **Layout:** A clean, data-table-like view of pending submissions. Key information (Cyrillic word, context) is scannable.
            -   **Blind Review:** Crucially, the table does NOT show who submitted the word or what the current approval count is. This prevents bias.
            -   **Reviewing:** Clicking an entry opens a detail view that mirrors the contribution modal but with action buttons: "Approve," "Reject," and "Edit & Approve." The context is prominently displayed.
        -   **Editing a Submission:** If Alima logs in, goes to her profile, and edits one of her pending submissions, the approval count for that word on the backend is reset to zero. This ensures the newly edited version goes through a fresh review cycle.
