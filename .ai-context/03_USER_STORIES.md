## 1. Core Conversion Experience

These stories define the fundamental, instant, and private nature of the app's main feature.

> **Alima (Language Learner):** As a language learner, I want to paste a news article in Cyrillic and see the Traditional Mongolian script instantly, so that I can practice my reading without worrying about my text being stored on a server.

> **Solongo (Content Creator):** As a content creator, I want to convert text in real-time as I type, so that I can speed up my workflow without breaking my creative flow.

> **Chen (Casual User):** As a casual user, I want to use the converter without signing up or waiting, so that I can satisfy my curiosity about a few words and move on.

> **Batbayar (Cultural Preservationist):** As a preservationist dealing with sensitive texts, I want the entire conversion to happen on my machine, so that I can maintain absolute confidentiality of the documents I work with.

## 2. Dual-Layer Dictionary System

These stories describe the user's need for both personal, immediate control over their dictionary and the long-term benefit of a community-updated resource.

> **Alima (Language Learner):** As a learner, I want to add a new slang term I just learned to my dictionary, so that it converts correctly for me immediately in my next session, even if the community hasn't approved it yet.

> **Batbayar (Cultural Preservationist):** As an expert, I want my specialized historical terms to be saved locally, so my documents convert accurately, but I also want to submit them to the community to improve the shared resource over time.

> **Solongo (Content Creator):** As a writer, I want the dictionary to automatically update in the background with new community-approved words, so that my conversions become more accurate over time without any effort on my part.

## 3. Graceful Ambiguity Resolution

This story defines the user need for handling cases where a single word or abbreviation has multiple valid options.

> **Solongo (Content Creator):** As a writer using a common abbreviation like "АН", I want the tool to show me that there are multiple options and let me easily choose between its possible Cyrillic expansions, like "Ардчилсан Нам" or "Америкийн Нэгдсэн Улс", so that the final converted text is accurate to my specific context without interrupting my workflow.

## 4. Crowdsourcing & Moderation

These stories cover the motivations for contributing to the community and the needs of the moderators who protect the quality of that resource.

> **Solongo (Content Creator):** As a writer, when I see an unconverted word, I want a quick way to add its translation and context, so that I can fix it for myself and help the community without leaving my workflow.

> **Chen (Casual User):** As an anonymous user, I want to suggest a translation for a word I know without creating an account, so that I can make a small contribution easily.

> **Ganbaatar (Moderator):** As a moderator, I want to review new submissions in a clear, context-rich interface, so that I can make accurate judgments on their validity and maintain the quality of the shared dictionary.

> **Alima (Language Learner):** As a contributor, I want to track the status of my submissions, so I can see if my contributions are being accepted and helping others.
