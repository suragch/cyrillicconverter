# Cyrillic-Traditional Mongolian Converter: Project Specification v3

## Elevator Pitch
A privacy-first web app that converts Cyrillic Mongolian text to Traditional Mongolian script instantly in your browserâ€”no server uploads required. Built on crowdsourced translation data with rigorous quality control, it empowers the Mongolian community to preserve and improve their linguistic heritage collaboratively while maintaining complete text privacy. Users can contribute translations that are immediately available locally, even before moderator approval.

## Problem Statement
Mongolian speakers who want to convert between Cyrillic and Traditional Mongolian script face several challenges:
- **Privacy concerns**: Existing tools often require uploading documents to external servers
- **Incomplete dictionaries**: Many proper nouns, technical terms, and modern vocabulary lack Traditional Mongolian equivalents
- **Limited community input**: Translations are often siloed, with no mechanism for collective improvement
- **Quality inconsistency**: Multiple valid spellings exist without guidance on which to use
- **Immediate needs vs community building**: Users need translations now but also want to contribute to shared knowledge

## Target Audience
**Primary Users:**
- Mongolian language learners and educators
- Cultural preservationists and historians
- Writers and content creators working with Traditional Mongolian script
- Government and institutional workers needing script conversion

**Secondary Users:**
- Linguists and researchers
- Diaspora communities reconnecting with traditional script
- Tourists and casual users exploring Mongolian language

## USP
- **Privacy-by-design**: All conversions happen client-side in the browser with no server uploads
- **Zero-friction access**: Instant conversion without signup
- **Immediate + community benefit**: Contributions are available locally instantly AND shared with community after moderation
- **Dual-layer dictionary**: User's personal dictionary + shared community dictionary
- **Rigorous quality control**: Multi-tier moderation system (net +5 approvals = fully accepted, net -3 = rejected)
- **Context-aware contributions**: Reviewers see surrounding words to validate rare/unusual terms
- **Progressive Web App**: Works offline with automatic database updates when online

## Target Platforms
- **Primary**: Progressive Web App (PWA) for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Responsive design**: Desktop and mobile web
- **Offline-first**: Full functionality without internet connection once dictionary is cached
