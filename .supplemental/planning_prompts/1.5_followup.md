## Critical Questions or Clarifications

### Technical Architecture

1. **Custom romanization system details**: You mentioned you'll provide the Latin-to-Mongolian character mapping later. When do you anticipate having this? This will be needed for:
   - Contribution input validation
   - On-screen keyboard layout
   - Live preview rendering
   - User documentation/help section

I'll provide at the point it is needed.

2. **Menksoft-to-Unicode algorithm**: You mentioned you have this algorithm. What format is it in (pseudocode, existing code in a specific language)? Will it need to be ported to JavaScript?

It is currently written in Dart. For the sake of planning, you can assume that it is already ported into JS and will be provided at the appropriate time.

3. **Database technology preference**: For the server-side dictionary storage, do you have a preference (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)? Given the lookup-heavy nature and potential for 2M records, I'd recommend PostgreSQL with proper indexing.

I'd like to use PocketBase for user authentication. For the dictionary data, PostgreSQL or PocketBase is fine. Whatever you think is best.

4. **Hosting & infrastructure**: Do you have preferences for:
   - Frontend hosting (Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3+CloudFront)?
   - Backend API (Node.js, Python, Go)?
   - Database hosting (managed service vs self-hosted)?

I'd like to do self hosted. I'll probably get a VPS. Frontend could be stored on GitHub and backed by Cloudflare. Backend on a VPS with a Docker container. The backend API should be Dart Shelf communicating with PocketBase for auth and Postgres as needed. Unless everything could be accomplished with PocketBase without the need for anything else. I'm not familiar with Go though.

### Dictionary & Data

5. **Initial dictionary seeding**: Do you have an existing word list to seed the database, or will it start completely empty and rely on crowdsourcing from day one?

There is an existing word list of 20 or 30 thousand words. These should be put in probation status though.

6. **Dictionary versioning**: How often do you anticipate pushing full dictionary updates vs incremental updates? (This impacts the sync strategy)

In the beginning about once a week. When the database becomes more stable, maybe once a month.

7. **One-to-many handling in database**: When a Cyrillic word has multiple valid Traditional Mongolian translations:
   - Should all variants be stored in the database?
   - How do we determine which variants to show users during conversion?
   - Do we track which variant is most commonly selected?

All variants should be stored in the database. Ask the user which variant to use. Don't track which variant is more commonly selected for now.

8. **Abbreviation database**: Should common abbreviations and their expansions be stored in the database (to avoid asking repeatedly), or should it prompt every time?

All abbreviations should be stored in the database. There may also be abbreviations with multiple expansions, in which case the user will need to choose. Abbreviation expansions should be moderated just like word conversion pairs.

An additional important note: When users add a word conversion pair or abbreviation expansion, then can choose to submit it to the server or just save it locally. Even if they do submit it to the server for moderation review, it is also saved locally so that it is immediately available. Having available locally is also a benefit to the user if the word is rejected by moderators.

### User Experience Refinements

9. **Session persistence**: Should user choices (for one-to-many selections with "use for all") persist beyond the current page session? For example:
   - Persist in browser localStorage for future visits?
   - If logged in, store preferences in user profile?

Don't persist beyond the current session.

10. **Contribution editing**: Can users edit their own pending contributions before they're reviewed? Or is it submit-once and wait for moderator feedback?

They can edit it.

11. **Moderation feedback loop**: When a moderator rejects a contribution, should the contributor receive notification/feedback about why it was rejected?

Don't notify the contributor. However, don't immediately reject a word just because one moderator rejects it. A word takes 3 rejects to be fully rejected. A reject also decrements the number of accept votes.

12. **Multiple moderator review interface**: If a word is in probation (has 1-4 approvals), should moderators see who already approved it? Or should reviews be blind to avoid groupthink?

Blind.

### PWA & Offline Behavior

13. **Contribution queuing**: If a user is offline and tries to contribute a word, should the PWA:
   - Queue the contribution and sync when online?
   - Disable the contribution feature entirely when offline?
   - Show an error message?

Disable contributions to the server but still update the user database. 

1.  **Update prompting**: When a new dictionary version is available, should the app:
   - Auto-update in the background and notify user when complete?
   - Prompt user before downloading (respecting data limits)?
   - Both options, with user preference setting?

Auto-update

### Moderation & Community Management

15. **Moderator test scoring**: For the 10-word test during moderator application:
   - What is the passing threshold (e.g., 8/10 correct)?
   - Are the 10 words randomized or the same for everyone?
   - Who creates/maintains the test questions?

9/10 for pass threshold
same order for everyone
I'll create the test questions and provide them at the appropriate time.

16. **Probation vs accepted logic**: You mentioned 1 approval = probation, 5 approvals = fully accepted. Questions:
   - Do probation words appear in the converter for users immediately, or only after 5 approvals?
   - If they appear in probation, should there be a visual indicator that it's not fully verified?

For the MVP, they appear immediately. In the future, we may wait for the full five approvals.

17. **Conflicting moderator decisions**: What happens if:
   - A word gets 2 approvals and 3 rejections?
   - Moderators submit conflicting edits to the same word?
   - Is there a senior moderator role to break ties?

If a word gets 2 approvals and 3 rejections, this is -1. Leave it in probation until the count becomes -3 or +5.

If a moderator edits the Cyrillic, this becomes a different word. If a moderator edits the latin (traditional Mongolian), this resets the approval to 1. There should be no conflicts except for the extremely rare case where two moderators are editing the same word at the same time. In this case, last write wins. Note that it is also possible to add an addition Mongolian spelling for a Cyrillic word. This creates a new db entry that also goes through moderation.

### Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

18. **Document upload**: You said MVP is plain text only. For future versions, would you want:
   - Word/PDF upload with client-side text extraction?
   - Batch conversion of multiple documents?

None of these are planned.

19. **Browser extension**: Would a browser extension (for converting text on any webpage) be valuable for future development?

No.

20. **Mobile app**: Beyond PWA, would native iOS/Android apps be in the roadmap?

Not in the near future.
