# Cyrillic-Traditional Mongolian Converter: Project Specification

## Elevator Pitch
A privacy-first web app that converts Cyrillic Mongolian text to Traditional Mongolian script instantly in your browserâ€”no server uploads required. Built on crowdsourced translation data, it empowers the Mongolian community to preserve and improve their linguistic heritage collaboratively.

## Problem Statement
Mongolian speakers who want to convert between Cyrillic and Traditional Mongolian script face several challenges:
- **Privacy concerns**: Existing tools often require uploading documents to external servers
- **Incomplete dictionaries**: Many proper nouns, technical terms, and modern vocabulary lack Traditional Mongolian equivalents
- **Limited community input**: Translations are often siloed, with no mechanism for collective improvement
- **Barrier to entry**: Users shouldn't need accounts just to perform basic conversions

## Target Audience
**Primary Users:**
- Mongolian language learners and educators
- Cultural preservationists and historians
- Writers and content creators working with Traditional Mongolian script
- Government and institutional workers needing script conversion

**Secondary Users:**
- Linguists and researchers
- Diaspora communities reconnecting with traditional script
- Tourists and casual users exploring Mongolian language

## USP
- **Privacy-by-design**: All conversions happen client-side in the browser
- **Zero-friction access**: Instant conversion without signup
- **Community-powered accuracy**: Crowdsourced dictionary that improves over time
- **Context-aware contributions**: Contributors see surrounding words when adding translations
- **Real-time visual feedback**: See Traditional Mongolian script rendered as you type Latin characters

## Target Platforms
- **Primary**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Responsive design**: Desktop and mobile web
- **Future consideration**: PWA (Progressive Web App) for offline functionality

## Critical Questions or Clarifications

### Technical Architecture
1. **Traditional Mongolian rendering**: Which Unicode blocks and fonts are you planning to use? Do you need to support all devices or will you provide a web font?
2. **Dictionary size**: How large do you expect the initial dictionary to be? This impacts loading strategy (full download vs. on-demand fetching)
3. **Conversion algorithm**: Do you have an existing algorithm/library for Cyrillic-to-Traditional Mongolian conversion, or does this need to be built from scratch?
4. **Latin transliteration system**: Which romanization system are you using for input (e.g., SASM/Transliteration standard)?

### User Experience
5. **Abbreviation detection**: How should the system identify abbreviations? Pattern matching, user marking, or machine learning?
6. **Context window size**: You mentioned "few surrounding words"â€”is 2-3 words before/after sufficient, or do you need more context?
7. **Unconverted word behavior**: Should the unconverted word remain in Cyrillic in the output, or be left blank, or marked with a special character?
8. **Offline capability**: Given the privacy focus, would offline functionality (PWA) be valuable for your users?

### Moderation & Community
9. **Moderation workflow**: Who becomes a moderator? Is there an application process, or is it invite-only?
10. **Contribution attribution**: Do you want to display contributor names/credits on accepted translations?
11. **Versioning**: If a word has multiple valid Traditional Mongolian forms, how should the system handle this? User preference, regional variants, or context-dependent?
12. **Quality control**: Should there be a minimum reputation or approval rate before contributions go live, or does everything require moderation first?

### Features & Scope
13. **Document format support**: You mentioned "no need to update documents to the server"â€”are you planning to support file uploads (Word, PDF) that are processed locally, or just plain text?
14. **Batch conversion**: Do users need to convert multiple texts in sequence, or is it one-time use per session?
15. **Export options**: Beyond copy-paste, do users need to download converted text in specific formats (.txt, .docx, etc.)?
16. **Pronunciation guide**: Would audio pronunciations be valuable alongside Traditional Mongolian text?
