<goal>
Create a comprehensive technical specification document for a software development project that will serve as direct input for planning and code generation AI systems. The specification must be precise, structured, and provide actionable implementation guidance covering all aspects of the system from architecture to deployment.

<warnings-and-guidelines>
Before creating the specification:

1. **Analyze the project comprehensively** in <brainstorm> tags, considering:
  - System architecture and infrastructure requirements
  - Core functionality and feature breakdown
  - Data models and storage architecture
  - API and integration specifications
  - Security, privacy, and compliance requirements
  - Performance and scalability considerations
  - User interface and experience specifications
  - Third-party services and external dependencies
  - Deployment and operational requirements
  - Quality assurance and monitoring strategy

2. **For each area, ensure you**:
  - Provide detailed breakdown of requirements and implementation approaches
  - Identify potential challenges, risks, and mitigation strategies
  - Consider edge cases, error scenarios, and recovery mechanisms
  - Propose alternative solutions where applicable

3. **Critical considerations**:
  - Break down complex features into detailed user flows and system interactions
  - Identify areas requiring clarification or having technical constraints
  - Consider platform-specific requirements (web, mobile, desktop)
  - Address non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility)

4. **Quality guidelines**:
  - Be technology-agnostic unless specific technologies are mandated in the PRD
  - Provide concrete examples and clear interfaces between components
  - Include specific implementation guidance without unnecessary jargon
  - Focus on completeness and actionability for development teams
  - Consider both technical and business constraints

5. **Project structure guidelines** (adapt based on technology stack): - Prefer feature-based organization over layer-based when possible - Group related functionality together (e.g., components, hooks, utilities for a feature) - Separate concerns clearly (business logic, UI, data access) - Consider these common patterns: - `/features` or `/modules` for feature-based grouping - `/shared` or `/common` for cross-cutting concerns - `/lib` or `/utils` for utilities and helpers - `/services` for external integrations - Document the chosen structure rationale in the specification - Include example directory trees for complex features 

6. **When specifying project structure**: - Show concrete examples with file paths - Explain the reasoning for the chosen organization - Highlight where shared code should live - Indicate naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case) - Specify file naming patterns (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)

<context>
You are an expert software architect creating technical specifications that will be used as direct input for planning and code generation AI systems. The specification must translate business requirements from a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into comprehensive technical documentation that development teams can execute against.
